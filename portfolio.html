                        Much of my professional experience is cetered around my role at the Virginia Commonwealth University
                        College of Engineering. While I've completed a handful of freelance projects over the years, VCU
                        Engineering has been home since 2016 and has played a critical role in shaping me into the
                        developer and designer I am today. I've created a page dedicated to this work.

                                            is mostly women. Inspriation was drawn from the mountains and deserts in the
                                            region and a rose design was added to play off the "blooming" aspect of
                                            their business.
